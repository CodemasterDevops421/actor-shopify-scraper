# Shopify Scraper

## Overview

Our Shopify Scraper is tailored for automating the extraction of detailed product data from Shopify-powered online stores. With this tool, you can monitor prices, descriptions, and other essential product details across various Shopify sites.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Automatically gather information like product titles, prices, and descriptions.
- **Proxy Support**: Utilize proxy settings to ensure privacy and bypass site restrictions during scraping sessions.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: The scraper waits for specific elements to load on the page, ensuring that all relevant data is captured, even from dynamically generated content.

## Getting Started

Configure the scraper by setting the URLs of the Shopify stores you want to monitor. Here's a basic example of how to set up your input configuration:

```json
{
    "urls": ["https://example-shopify.com"],
    "waitForSelector": ".product-grid-item",
    "useProxy": true
}
```
